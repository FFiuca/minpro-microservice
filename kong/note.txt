X-Kong-Request-Debug header
If the X-Kong-Request-Debug header is set to *, timing information will be collected and exported for the current request.
If this header isn’t present or contains an unknown value, timing information will not be collected for the current request.

X-Kong-Request-Debug-Log header
If the X-Kong-Request-Debug-Log header is set to true, timing information will also be logged in the Kong Gateway error log with a log level of notice. By default, the X-Kong-Request-Debug-Log header is set to false. The log line will have the [request-debug] prefix to aid in searching.

X-Kong-Request-Debug-Token header
The X-Kong-Request-Debug-Token is a token for authenticating the client and making the debug request to prevent abuse. Debug requests originating from loopback addresses don’t require this header.
